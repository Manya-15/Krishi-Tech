KrishiTech is an innovative startup and hackathon project developed by four passionate students: Piyush, Nikita, Manya, and Ritwick. We are currently pursuing our B.Tech degrees in Artificial Intelligence & Data Science from the University School of Automation & Robotics, Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University.
Our journey began with our participation in the BUILDWITHINDIA HACKATHON, where we embraced the theme of Smart Agriculture to create KrishiTech. Our mission is to revolutionize farming practices and improve the livelihoods of farmers by leveraging the power of technology.
KrishiTech aims to be a one-stop destination for farmers worldwide, offering a comprehensive suite of features that include crop prediction based on weather and location, raw material and fertilizer suggestions, disease prediction through image uploads, and a marketplace to connect farmers with buyers. Additionally, we provide valuable information on government schemes and offer a platform for farmers to seek expert advice and support.
Our app and dashboard are continuously updated to enhance performance and introduce new features, ensuring that KrishiTech remains at the forefront of agricultural innovation. We are committed to making a positive impact on the agricultural sector and empowering farmers with the tools and knowledge they need to succeed.
